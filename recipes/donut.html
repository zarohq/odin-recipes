  <h4>Ingredients...</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups milk(360 mL), warm to the touch</li>
      <li>1 cup sugar(200 g)</li>
      <li>1 stick unsalted butter, soft</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>5 cups flour(625 g), sifted</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil
        shortening, for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>The process...</h4>
  <ol>
      <li><p>In a medium bowl, add the milk, sugar, and yeast, stirring to combine.
        In a separate medium bowl, add the butter, eggs, and vanilla extract, stirring to combine.</p>
    </li>
      <li><p>Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, until smooth. Gently poke the dough with a finger--the dough should bounce back up from the indentation.
        Place the dough in a large bowl, and <strong>lightly coat</strong> the dough with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.</p>
        </li>
      <li><p>Melt enough shortening over medium heat to come up just 2 inches (5 cm) up on the side of a heavy frying pan. <strong>Heat the shortening to 375°F (190°C)</strong>
        Fry the donuts and donut holes for 45 seconds on each side, or until golden brown.
        In a bowl, combine the powdered sugar, dry milk powder, vanilla extract and hot water until smooth.</p>
        </li>
  </ol>
